 * S.N.A.P link layer
 *
 * The following conditions are assumed about the link-layer:
 *   - calls external function "void snap_lnk_recv(u08 value, u08 err)" when
 *     received a byte
 *   - preamble bytes are managed by the link layer an not passed to network layer
 *   - function "snap_lnk_recv" is called with interrupts disabled
 *   - manages medium access, espacially "snap_lnk_send_start()" may block until
 *     line is free (CSMA)
 *   - while sending "snap_lnk_recv" is nerver called, that is we do not listen
 *     to ourself
